# OBS-next-scene-hotkey
A simple Lua script for OBS that lets you assign hotkeys to move to the next scene or previous scene.

## Details

This Lua script adds hotkeys for Next Scene and Previous Scene, which let you cycle through your scenes in OBS from the keyboard.

I use OBS like a slideshow/presentation deck so this helps me cycle through dozens of scenes during a broadcast.

## Installation

It can be installed using the Tools --> Scripts menu in OBS.

## Disclaimer

DISCLAIMER: I'm new to OBS and quickly rigged this up because every other plugin/script seemed to be a very complicated scene switcher and all I wanted was a basic hotkey. I believe I've programmed it properly but I'm new to both Lua and OBS scripting.
